## Using Google Sheets + Docs as a database for a simple personal homepage

Neutral, clean, responsive personal home page that utilises Google Sheets as a database and Google Docs for text/image-based content. No server-side scripts used.

Example sheet can be found at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x1M2mwl7eSxDxuKrrQ0B6eNCBHqzaaGZOZrtwvZyNyM/edit?usp=sharing
